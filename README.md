# Programming Assignment ‚Äî Gaussian Elimination

This repository contains my programming assignment for implementing the **Gaussian Elimination** algorithm, a fundamental method in linear algebra used for solving systems of linear equations.

## üìö Project Overview

**Gaussian Elimination** is one of the most widely taught numerical methods for solving linear equations.  
It works by transforming a system‚Äôs augmented matrix into an upper triangular matrix (row-echelon form) and then applying back-substitution to find the solution for all variables.

This assignment demonstrates:
- How to convert a system of equations to matrix form.
- Step-by-step forward elimination to zero out coefficients below the main diagonal.
- Backward substitution to find the final solutions.
